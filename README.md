# Block factor-width-two cone program
Reformulation of SDPs using block factor-width two matrices

factorwidth.m approximates an SDP in the standard primal vectorized form

		minimize 	c'x					
    subject to	Ax = b,					
		x \in K				

where the conic constraint `x \in K` is cartesian products of the following cones:

* R^n (free variables)
* Non-negative orthant
* Second-order cone
* Positive semidefinite cone

with a block factor-width-two cone. Only the PSD cones are approximated.
